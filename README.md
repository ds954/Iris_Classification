# Iris_Classification

## Overview of the Project

### Project: Iris Classification

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to classify iris flowers based on their features using Python and scikit-learn. The Jupyter notebook `Iris classification.ipynb` contains the entire workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load the Iris dataset from scikit-learn.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Train a Gaussian Naive Bayes model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy score.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the results using matplotlib.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine Learning library for model training and evaluation.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: Plotting and data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive computing environment.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ds954/Iris_Classification.git
   cd Iris_Classification
